# Data types

## Built-in

* Booleans (True, False)
* Numbers (int, long, float, complex)
* Strings ("...", '...')
* Lists (Anything that is listed between \[\] and separated with a comma for example: `[1, 3.0, 5, True, "Sier"]`). _more on lists later_ 
* Tuple (A tuple is like a list, but with the difference that a tuple is inmutable and is denoted with  `(...)` instead of `[]`). _more on tuples later_
* Dictionary (A dictionary is a data type that works as map or an assignment between "keys" and "values", they are denoted with `{}`). _more on dictionaries later_


### Numbers

Numbers represent mathematic values, this mean numbers in general, the most common are the **int** and the **float** which represents the common values that appears in operations. When a numbers is to big to fit in a int it is transformed automatically into a _long_ which is a big number, it also can be represented as an octal notation or a number finished with an "L".

Float numbers also are represented with exponential notation. For example 32.9+e21 

Complex numbers involve a _real_ and an _imaginary_ part, this numbers have different operations and are available in python as a native data type. This kind of numbers are written like `R + Ij` where _R_ represents the _real_ part with a `+` and the _imaginary_ part in this case, noted by a _I_. The _imaginary_ part is a real number which must also include a _j_ to denote that is the imaginary part, this _j_ could also be upper case.

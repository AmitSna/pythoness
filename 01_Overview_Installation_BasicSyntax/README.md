# 1 Overview. Installation. Basic Language Syntax

## Overview.

Python is a general-purpose, interpreted, high-level, dynamic programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.

### Advantages of Python

Most of the advantage of **Python** involves his _interpreted_ nature, but at the same time it offers a big set of options to develop:

* Is Interpreted
* Is Interactive
* Is Object-Oriented
* Is for Beginners
* Can work as Functional Language

Also the language by itself offers other things, beign _intepreted_ allows the language to be:

* Dynamic typed
* Use of _type inference_
* Allow explicit type definition as well as IMPLICIT typing
* OS Independent

But not all can be sugar and honey, python also has his disadvantages and they are explained next

### Disadvantages

Beign _interpreted_ makes the language great, but also makes the language to be slower or "interpreter dependant", which means that the language will work as fast as the interpreter allows. 
Let's add that you can fix this issue/problem recompiling the full interpreter to make a better performance and also the interpreter by itself makes optimization on the fly like _caching_, that makes the language faster.

Other problem that you eventually find is that the versioning is a mess and you have to decide if you are going to work with **Python 2** or **Python 3** or maybe a flavor of python (like Jython or Cython or some hybrid beast that allows you to run pseudo python code mixed with other stuff). And once you decide, you cannot mix ~~(well, actually you can but is messy)~~ _python 2 code_ with _python 3 code_ and this has been a known issue for a lot of time.
